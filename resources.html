							Facts About Government Regulations or lack thereof
						</h4>
						<p>The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) includes 112 pages of standards for food and drugs, but just two pages for cosmetic safety. The cosmetics title of the FFDCA, which has not been amended significantly since it was enacted more than 80 years ago, provides virtually no power to perform even the most rudimentary functions to ensure the safety of an estimated $84 billion cosmetic industry.
						</p>
						<p>In the absence of government authority, the safety of personal care product ingredients is evaluated through a voluntary industry program known as the Cosmetic Ingredient Review process. The CIR has reviewed less than 20% of the FDA estimated 12,500 chemicals used in cosmetics, and of those the CIR has reviewed, they have found only 9 chemicals unsafe for use in cosmetics. What safety data does exist focuses on acute reactions to products, such as skin rashes or allergic reactions, as opposed to studies that look at chronic health effects from chemicals in personal care products, like cancer, reproductive or nervous system effect that are driven by genetic susceptibility, the timing of exposure, and aggregate exposures over a lifetime.</p>

							All About Counterfeit Make-up
						</h4>
						<p> What is Counterfeit Make-up: Fake make-up that is highly dangerous that looks like the real make-up. Global seizures of the fake stuff jumped 25 percent between 2011 and 2013. In 2016 alone, the government reportedly seized over 2.8 million fake makeup products (most of them MAC knockoffs).</p>
						<p>The FBI reports that its agents have found human carcinogens, aluminum, dangerous levels of bacteria, and even human urine and feces (!!!) in the products theyâ€™ve seized.</p>
