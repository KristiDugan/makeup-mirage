                      Retinol and retinyl palmitate are produced by commercial
                      methods but can be found naturally in animal fats, in fish
                      liver oil, and in plants that contain beta-carotene, a
                      vitamin A precursor. Retinol is essential for vision,
                      growth, and reproduction. Retinyl palmitate is produced
                      from Retinol and is sometimes referred to as vitamin A
                      palmitate when used as a nutrient or drug. In addition to
                      their use in cosmetics and personal care products, both
                      ingredients can be found in foods and in vitamin
                      supplements.

                      Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient required for
                      collagen production, tissue repair, and for the synthesis
                      of neurotransmitters. It also acts as an antioxidant,
                      plays a role in resistance to infections, and is used for
                      the treatment and prevention of scurvy. The U.S.
                      Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for Ascorbic Acid is 75
                      mg/kg/day for women and 90 mg/kg/day for men. Citrus
                      fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, lime), tomatoes and
                      potatoes are rich dietary sources of Ascorbic Acid.

                      Tocopherol, a fat-soluble vitamin, is found in vegetable
                      fats and oils, dairy products, meat, eggs, cereals, nuts,
                      and leafy green and yellow vegetables. It is usually
                      present in these foods as mixtures of different forms:
                      alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-Tocopherol. The alpha
                      form has the same biological activity as vitamin
                      E.Tocopherols can be produced from vegetable oils or can
                      be synthesized. Tocopherol Acetate, made by the
                      esterification of Tocopherol with acetic acid, is
                      frequently the source of vitamin E in dietary supplements.

                      oxidation) to vitamin B5 in the skin. Pantothenic Acid is
                      found in all living cells and tissues and is essential for
                      normal metabolism and hormone production. In cosmetics and
                      personal care products, two forms of Panthenol can be
                      found: D-Panthenol occurs as a viscous oil and
                      DL-Panthenol occurs as a creamy white, crystalline powder.

                      Also known as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, salicylic acid occurs
                      naturally in the bark of the willow tree, Salix alba, and
                      methyl salicylate is present in wintergreen leaves,
                      Gaultheria procumbens, and in sweet birch bark, Betula
                      lenta. Salicylic acid is probably best known as a compound
                      that is chemically similar but not identical to the active
                      component of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).

                      Glycerin is a precursor for synthesis of triglycerides and

                      acids are released into the bloodstream.
